# phpmap

**phpmap** is a modular PHP vulnerability scanner and exploitation framework, designed to automate the discovery of common PHP-based web application flaws. Inspired by `sqlmap`, `phpmap` targets vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), upload bypasses, and PHP deserialization bugs.

phpmap is designed with modularity and ethical testing in mind and aims to meet Kali Linux packaging standards.
