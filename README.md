# phpmap

**phpmap** is a modular PHP vulnerability scanner and exploitation framework, designed to automate the discovery of common PHP-based web application flaws. Inspired by `sqlmap`, `phpmap` targets vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), upload bypasses, and PHP deserialization bugs.
